## 🎉 News

* 🧭 Apr 26, 2026: **Agent evolution** in Trajectory Hub: **segmented** runs + `ms_agent.trajectory` **metrics** → **SFT** → **self-training**; training is **supported by [Twinkle](https://github.com/modelscope/twinkle)** and runs in a **client-server training framework** (Twinkle workbench). [Trajectory Hub](docs/en/Components/TrajectoryHub.md).
* 🧬 Apr 19, 2026: **Skill evolution** lands in Skill Hub: related memories form **semantic clusters**, then **crystallize** into multi-step workflow skills and **re-crystallize** when enough new evidence arrives, with **provenance-grounded verification** and a **structure-score upgrade gate** so evolved skills cannot regress. See [Skill Hub](docs/en/Components/SkillHub.md#skill-self-evolution) and [Configuration](docs/en/Components/Config.md#skill-evolution).

## Getting started

There are two ways to use Ultron depending on your role:

| I want to... | Go to |
|---|---|
| **Connect my agent** to an existing Ultron service | [→ Agent Setup](#-agent-setup-connect-your-agent) |
| **Self-host Ultron** and run the server myself | [→ Server Deployment](#-server-deployment-self-host) |

---

## Overview

Ultron is a **self-evolving collective intelligence system** for general-purpose AI agents, built around three core hubs — **Memory Hub**, **Skill Hub**, and **Harness Hub**. It distills scattered, session-local experience into **collective knowledge** that is **easy to retrieve and reuse**: one shared pitfall helps the whole team avoid the same mistake; one proven fix becomes a reusable skill that **evolves automatically as new evidence accumulates**; a carefully tuned agent profile can be published as a **shared blueprint** that other agent instances **load in one step**. On the server side, Ultron can also **self-train and self-evolve a model** from high-quality trajectories accumulated in Trajectory Hub, and later **lower user-side model cost** by routing through that model.

### Why collective intelligence?

#### 🙅️ Session-bound agents

- **Experience dies with the session**: fixes, pitfalls, and runbook fragments vanish when a session ends; the next agent starts from zero.                        
- **Discovery cost multiplies**: when *N* agents hit the same problem independently, the fleet pays *N* times the investigation cost.                              
- **Tuned profiles don't travel**: a carefully wired agent persona, skill set, and tool configuration stays local — every new instance retrains from scratch. 

#### 🙆️ Ultron-powered agents

- **Collective memory**: experience is captured, deduplicated, and semantically recalled before reasoning — the whole fleet learns from every session.             
- **Memory crystallizes into self-evolving skills**: once a fix is validated often enough, it graduates from memory into a reusable skill — and continues to evolve automatically as new evidence accumulates.
- **One-click blueprints**: an expert-tuned agent profile — persona, memories, and skills included — publishes as a shareable blueprint that other instances import in one step.

### Effect comparison

> Scenario: A developer asks an agent to debug a `sessions_spawn` error when using `mode="session"` to create a sub-agent. Another agent had already hit this exact pitfall and the solution was distilled into collective memory.

#### ❌ Without Ultron

> **User**: I want to use sessions_spawn to create a sub-agent for parallel tasks with mode=session, but it keeps erroring out. What's wrong?
>
> **Agent**: Based on my tool definitions, you should use the `spawn` tool, not `sessions_spawn`.
>
> *Agent doesn't recognize sessions_spawn at all — sends the user in a completely wrong direction.*

#### ✅ With Ultron

> **User**: I want to use sessions_spawn to create a sub-agent for parallel tasks with mode=session, but it keeps erroring out. What's wrong?
>
> **Agent**: Found the issue based on recalled experience!
>
> 📌 Recalled memory: `sessions_spawn` with `mode="session"` requires `thread=true` and channel plugins that register `subagent_spawning` hooks. Without those hooks, it fails regardless of parameter correctness.
>
> *1 round — root cause identified, scenario-specific solutions provided.*

| Dimension | Without Ultron | With Ultron |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Tool recognition | Doesn't know `sessions_spawn`, misleads to `spawn` | Accurately identifies the tool and its constraints |
| Root cause | Completely off track | Pinpoints missing `thread=true` or channel hooks |
| Solution | Invalid | Scenario-specific: `mode="run"` vs `mode="session"` |
| Knowledge source | Agent guesses from scratch | Recalls proven pitfall experience from collective memory |

## Core capabilities

### 🧭 Trajectory Hub

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Task segmentation** | Splits session `.jsonl` into independent task segments; long conversations are handled in multiple token-budgeted windows |
| **Metrics** | Uses `ms_agent.trajectory` to write per-segment quality metrics for memory and training filters |
| **Incremental tracking** | Content fingerprints skip unchanged segments; when appended writes change a segment, old memories are invalidated and the segment is reprocessed |
| **Deferred extraction** | Ingest only records the session; background jobs on `decay_interval_hours` segment, score, and extract memories |
| **Model self-evolution** | Server-side self-training and self-evolution on high-quality trajectories; can reduce user model cost later via a router |

### 💭 Memory Hub

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Tiered storage** | HOT / WARM / COLD tiers with percentile-based rebalancing by `hit_count`; embedding-based semantic search with tier boost |
| **L0 / L1 / Full layering** | Auto-generated one-line summary (L0) and core overview (L1); search returns L0/L1 to save tokens, full content on demand |
| **Auto type classification** | LLM-first, keyword-fallback classification on upload; callers never specify `memory_type` |
| **Dedup & merge** | Near-duplicate vectors auto-merged within same type, embeddings and summaries re-computed; batch consolidation available |
| **Intent-expanded search** | Queries expanded into multi-angle search phrases for better recall |
| **Continuous time decay** | `hotness = exp(-α × days)` — unused memories degrade automatically in search ranking |
| **Smart ingestion** | Files, text, or `.jsonl` session logs accepted; LLM auto-extracts structured memories with incremental progress tracking |
| **Data sanitization** | Presidio-based bilingual (EN/ZH) PII detection, auto-redacted before storage |

### 🧬 Skill Hub

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Skill distillation** | Memories entering HOT tier auto-generate reusable skills; agents can also upload skill packages directly |
| **Skill self-evolution** | Re-crystallizes automatically when a cluster accumulates enough new memories; evidence-grounded verification and a structure-score upgrade gate ensure each evolution is strictly better |
| **Unified discovery** | Internal distilled skills and 30K+ externally indexed ModelScope skills searchable in one place |
| **Improvement suggestions** | Semantically similar memories surface as enhancement candidates for existing skills |

### 🌐 Harness Hub

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Profile publishing** | Publish a complete agent profile — persona, memories, and skills — as a shareable blueprint with short-code import |
| **Bidirectional sync** | Agent workspace state syncs up/down to the server for multi-device continuity |
| **Soul presets** | Compose agent personas from a preset library (role, MBTI, zodiac, etc.) and generate workspace resources |

## Typical use cases

- **Shared pitfall avoidance (Memory Hub)**: Agent A hits "MySQL 8.0 default charset breaks emoji inserts" and the fix is distilled into Memory Hub. Weeks later, Agent B setting up a new database gets the same memory surfaced automatically — trap skipped, zero re-investigation.                                               
- **Ops skill packages (Skill Hub)**: An SRE packages "K8s OOMKilled → locate leak → adjust limits → canary verify" as a reusable skill. Other teams' agents discover and follow the same steps instead of reinventing the workflow. As more agents encounter related incidents and their memories accumulate, the skill re-crystallizes automatically — incorporating new edge cases and keeping the playbook current.
- **Domain-expert agents (Harness Hub)**: A DevOps engineer spends weeks tuning an agent into a Kubernetes specialist — memories, skills, and persona included. They publish the profile to Harness Hub; anyone imports it in one click.
